# Core Concepts
This guide covers the essentials for instrumenting your Python application with Agensight:
1. _Initializing_ the tracing system using init().
2. Defining top-level operations or requests as _traces_ using the @trace decorator.
3. Instrumenting specific units of work within a trace as _spans_ using the @span decorator.
## Initializing Agensight Tracing
Before any traces or spans can be created, you must initialize the Agensight tracing system using init() — typically once at the beginning of your application.
_Purpose_:
Sets up the tracing backend (local or cloud), trace/session ID handling, and optional auto-instrumentation of LLM providers.
_Parameters_:
- name (str): Name of your app/service for trace attribution.
- mode (str): One of local, dev, or prod. Determines if data is stored locally (SQLite) or sent to cloud via Lambda.
- project_id (str): Required for cloud mode to associate records in Supabase.
- session (str | dict | None): Optional session ID or metadata. If provided, it associates all traces/spans with this session.
_Usage Example:_
```python
import agensight
agensight.init(
    name="chatbot-with-tools",
    mode="prod",
    project_id="abc12345",
    session="user_123"  # Can be just a session ID
)
```

## Defining Traces with @trace
Use @trace to define a _top-level operation_ (e.g. API handler, main pipeline, or user workflow). This starts a trace and includes session \+ metadata.
```python
@trace(name="multi_agent_chat", session={"id": "xyz123", "name": "multi agent chat", "user_id": "123"})
def main():
    ...
```
- Automatically generates a unique trace_id
- Associates any child spans
- Ties to provided session metadata (if any)
---
## Instrumenting with @span
Use @span to annotate _specific operations_ like LLM calls, tool invocations, or data steps.
```python
@span(name="llm")
def call_llm(messages):
    return client.chat.completions.create(...)
```
- Captures input, output, execution time
- Extracts LLM usage if present
- Handles tool call spans automatically when tool_choice=auto
---
## Session Behavior
> :information_source: _Note on Sessions_:
>
> - If both init() and @trace() specify a session, the @trace() value takes precedence for that specific trace.
> - If you pass only a string (e.g. session="user_123"), it is treated as a session_id.
> - To improve traceability, you can pass a full dictionary: id, name, user_id.
>
> _Example_:
>
> ```python
> @trace(name="do_task", session="user_123")  # Overrides session from init()
> def do_task():
>     ...
> ```
>
> Supplying a full dict `{id, name, user_id}` improves tracking and grouping but is optional.
Before any traces or spans can be created, you must initialize the Agensight tracing system using `init()` — typically once at the beginning of your application.

## Example: Multi-Agent Chat with Tools
```python
import agensight
from agensight.tracing.decorators import trace, span
agensight.init(name="chat-service", mode="prod", project_id="abc12345", session="user_456")
@span(name="llm")
def call_llm(messages):
    # Simulate an LLM call with tool use
    return {"content": "Mock response", "tool_used": "get_weather"}
@trace(name="multi_agent_chat", session="user_789")
def main():
    plan = call_llm([{"role": "user", "content": "Weather in Paris?"}])
    summary = call_llm([{"role": "user", "content": f"Summarize: {plan['content']}"}])
    print("Final Output:", summary["content"])
main()
```
This simplified example demonstrates how multiple LLM calls, each wrapped with @span, are grouped under a trace using @trace. Session IDs ensure all trace data is linked and queryable in your observability dashboard.

## Cloud Export
In prod or dev mode, Agensight automatically sends observability data to your configured cloud setup (e.g. via AWS Lambda and Supabase).
To enable this, ensure:
- You've set mode="prod" or mode="dev" in init()
- A valid project_id is provided
- Your backend infrastructure (e.g. Lambda, database) is correctly configured to receive logs
Agensight will capture and transmit structured data for:
- traces: top-level operations
- spans: fine-grained steps and LLM/tool calls
- prompts and completions: LLM input/output and token usage
- tools: invoked tool functions
- sessions: grouped user journeys or workflows
All of this data becomes accessible via your observability dashboard for inspection, debugging, or analytics -**traces, spans, prompts, completions, tools, sessions**
